# JavaJythonConverter

Converter from Java to Jython (and close to Python)

This was all motivated by finally finding an ideal AST for Java, so I can create a more exact
translation.  (Autoplot's Java to Python converter was basically a bunch of regex checks, and
this is already a huge improvement.)  Also we'd like to convert TimeUtil.java and URITemplates.java
into Python for use in HAPI.
